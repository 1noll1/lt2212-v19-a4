# Preparation

## PyTorch 
The tutorial for the Data Parallelism is [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)

## Data 
I have downloaded the data and they are massive files so it might be good to save them outside the git repo just to avoid accidentally trying to push them, they're like 200mbs compressed... 
The Google News vectors is also massive, like over a gb so you might want to save these locally and we will keep them out of the git repo. 

# Part 1:preprocessing 

## To do:
* args for randomly selecting data-size
* Ideas for tokenisation (not required but might be nice to do) e.g lowercase, stopwords,regexes
* Lines must be truncated so they are same length e.g line 1: Je suis Rob, line 2: my name is not Rob, then line two will have to have the last word cut off so that they are the same length. It's going to be a really naive translator so the output will look kinda silly. Old school google translate
